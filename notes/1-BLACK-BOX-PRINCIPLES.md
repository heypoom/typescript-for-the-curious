# Black Box Principles

This is the principles behind this class.

## Pain Point

I hate online courses and university courses because it felt like I was being spoon-fed information. I don't feel the joy of discovery like self-learning.

## Black Box Learning

a.k.a. _Fuck around and Find Out._

_You don't know HOW the black box works._
_You know WHAT you can do with it._
What can you do?

In this case, the _TypeScript compiler_ is our black box.

We feed in a code sample into the TypeScript black box, and it gives us the type information back when we hover over the variable or type.

## A. Curiosity

_What can I do with it?_
_Why is this API designed like that?_
_Why is this code duplicated?_
_What if I change this value? What if I paste this snippet?_

## B. Intuition.

This feels very similar to that.
_Ah, what if I apply that method to this?_

This feels _wrong_. It's tedious.
_This is not the way to go. We should try a different method._
_Is there a more straightforward method?_

This doesn't make sense.
_We should trace back our thoughts._

This feels _painful_. It feels _inefficient_.
_Can we optimize it more?_

## Curiosity + Intuition = Experimentation

Your curiosity and intuition should make you ask:
_What if I try something like this?_

Then, you formulate an experiment, and you discover things yourself.

## C. Reason

When a hacker hacks a black box system, what would they ask?
_If I were the developer, I would design the system like X._
_So, there might be the Y vulnerability._

From the result of your experiment, you should be able to reason _or make an educated guess_ about why the tools, languages or frameworks are designed the way they are.

What is the _reason_ behind this technical decision or implementation?
_I suppose they designed it this way because of XXX?_

## Outcome

_Let's say you found a strange error._
Your curiosity kicks in: _Hmm, why does the error has X in it?_
Your intuition kicks in: _Can we divide and conquer and disable X, Y, Z first?_
Your reasoning kicks in: _Ah, I think it's caused by how X and Z interacts!_

Curiosity develops into Intuition, and vice-versa.
Intuition develops into Reasoning, and vice-versa.

_Don't just learn the tool. Learn the thought process._
