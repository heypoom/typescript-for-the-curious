# TypeScript for the Curious

_Description TBA_

## Key Principles

- I don't like online courses because of spoon-feeding information, so I want to develop an exploratory course where you can discover concepts by yourself.

- Learn by examples and use cases. You should understand the exact problem, and understand why we need to introduce concepts and abstractions to solve the problem.

- [Learn by your curiosity.](./notes/1-BLACK-BOX-PRINCIPLES.md) You should be able to naturally discover concepts by yourself, and develop your own intuition and reasoning to further explore TypeScript after the course. You should feel like you could've been the author of TypeScript!
